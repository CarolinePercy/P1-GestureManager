Once it's done importing, the package should now be in your project.

### Setting up the component
The components in this package are pre-designed to be added onto any object without any prior preperation. All you need to do is add on methods from other scripts, that will trigger when the corresponding action will happen.
To see an example of this, go to the sample scene located in the package.
